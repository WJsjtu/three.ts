Mipmap就可以解决上面那两个问题。当加载纹理的时候，不单单是加载一个纹理，而是加载一系列从大到小的纹理当mipmapped纹理状态中。\n         * 然后OpenGl会根据给定的几何图像的大小选择最合适的纹理。Mipmap是把纹理按照2的倍数进行缩放，直到图像为1x1的大小，然后把这些图都存储起来，当要使用的就选择一个合适的图像。\n         * 这会增加一些额外的内存。在正方形的纹理贴图中使用mipmap技术，大概要比原先多出三分之一的内存空间。\n         *\n         * Mipmap的纹理过滤模式如下表：\n         * 常量\t描述\n         * GL_NEAREST\t在mip基层上使用最邻近过滤\n         * GL_LINEAR\t在mip基层上使用线性过滤\n         *
